Data communication is defined as the exchange of data between two or more
connected devices over some types of transmission medium, such as copper cable
or the Internet. These devices must be capable of both sending and receiving
data. The 5 main components of data communication are:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Sender: A sender is a device that can send data over a network,
such as a computer, a mobile phone, a broadcaster, etc.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Receiver: A receiver is a device that can receive data from the
network, such as a radio, a printer, etc. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Message: The data exchanged between the sender and the receiver.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Transmission medium: It is the path that the message travels
between the origin and the destination. This path could be either wired (cable)
or wireless (the Internet).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Protocols: It is a set of rules and agreements between devices
that must be followed by the communicating parties in order to have successful
and reliable data communication.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">2. The OSI model includes
7 layers, from data to network:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 7 – Application: The Application Layer is located at the very top of the OSI Model
layer, where network applications run. These programs generate the data that
must be sent across the network. This layer also facilitates access for application services to access the
network and present information to the user.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 6 – Presentation: The Presentation Layer represents the
preparation or translation of the application format from or to the network format. In
other words, the layer translates,
encrypts, and compresses data, so that they could be used by upper or lower
layers.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 5 – Session: The Session Layer creates a session in which
connected devices on a network can communicate with each other. The layer
establishes, manages, and terminates sessions, as well as security and authentication.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 4 – Transport: The layer serves the Application Layer and
receives services from the Network Layer. It is in charge of delivering the
entire message from beginning to end. The transport layer also provides
reliable process-to-process message delivery and error recovery. Segments are
the units of data in this layer. A good example of this layer is the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 3 – Network: The Network Layer is responsible for data
transfer between hosts on various networks. It also handles packet routing,
which is the determination of the quickest path to send the packet from the
available routes. The network layer inserts the IP addresses of the sender and
receiver into the header. Packets are the units of data in this layer.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 2 – Data Link: The Data Link Layer is in charge of message
transport from node to node. This layer's primary duty is to provide error-free
data flow from one node to another over the physical layer. When a packet
enters a network, it is DLL's obligation to send it to the Host using its MAC
address. Frames are the units of data in this layer. The layer also organizes
bits from the physical into frames.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Layer 1 – Physical: The Physical Layer manages the physical
connection between the devices. Bits are the units of data in this layer. It is
in charge of sending individual bits from one node to the next. When this layer
receives data, it converts the incoming signal into 0s and 1s and sends them to
the Data Link layer, which reassembles them into frames. The layer also
provides mechanical and electrical specifications.</span></p>

 <span lang="EN-IN">3. - Bus topology: A shared wire connects
all devices (such as PCs in a computer network). The end systems' connection to
the bus is passive. This implies that each end system can read data from the
bus but is not responsible for passing it to other terminals. A data unit is
always received by all end systems on a bus, even though the data unit is
normally only intended for one end system. As a result, only one end system may
transmit a data unit through the bus at any given moment. Otherwise, data units
from multiple end systems would overlap and cannot be correctly received. A
termination resistor is used to prevent signal reflections at the cable ends.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN"><img src="image.png" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-fluid"></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Star topology: All end systems in a star topology are connected to
one another via an extra network component (star coupler) utilizing their own
cables. The star coupler is not the end of the line. It just serves to send
data units. Every communication is routed through the star coupler as a result
of this setup. There are two kinds of star couplers: </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">• A hub sends signals received on one port to all other ports. This
is quite straightforward and hence inexpensive to implement because no
addresses must be assessed, among other reasons. As a result, only one device
may transfer data at the same time. Otherwise, collisions, such as in bus
topology, may occur. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">• A switch forwards signals selectively, that is, just to the end
system that will receive the data unit. This necessitates the evaluation of
addresses during forwarding and the management of which end system is linked to
which port. However, this has the advantage of allowing concurrent
communication across end systems. For example, an end system at port 1 can
transfer a data unit to an end system at port 2, while end systems at ports 3
and 4 interact with one another simultaneously. The number of parallel
communications that are actually possible is determined by the switch's
internal capabilities.</span></p>

 <span lang="EN-IN">&nbsp;<img src="image%20%281%29.png" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-fluid"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-IN">- Tree topology: A tree topology is formed when numerous systems of
star topology are merged to form a bigger unit by linking star couplers
together. This structure is frequently utilized as the foundation for a
hierarchical network, which is commonly employed in office buildings. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN"><img src="image%20%282%29.png" alt="" role="presentation" class="img-fluid"></span></p><p><span lang="EN-IN">- Mesh topology: There are redundant connections in a mesh
architecture to safeguard the network from breakdowns. In a completely meshed
network, all network nodes are linked to one another. Even with a few nodes,
this situation is just theoretical because the cost and labor for building all
of the mesh connections grow substantially. A partly meshed network is one in
which the possible redundant connections are only partially realized. In this
instance, you might, for example, build the network so that each node is linked
to at least three other nodes. Then, even if two links fail, you may continue.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">4.- Local area network (LAN): A LAN is a network that exists inside
the confines of an organization and can range in size from 10 m to 10 km.
Ethernet technology has become the only option for local area networks with no
specific requirements. The situation is similar with wireless local area
networks, where only Wireless LAN technology is now available.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">- Metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans between 10
and 100 kilometers. There were formerly particular technologies (like FDDI)
created for MANs. Instead, LAN or WAN technology is employed nowadays.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IN">-
Wide area network (WAN): A WAN is a network that spans more than 100
kilometers, such as a national network. Different technologies, such as IP,
Ethernet, SDH, OTN, or MPLS, are used in these networks.</span></p><br><p></p>
