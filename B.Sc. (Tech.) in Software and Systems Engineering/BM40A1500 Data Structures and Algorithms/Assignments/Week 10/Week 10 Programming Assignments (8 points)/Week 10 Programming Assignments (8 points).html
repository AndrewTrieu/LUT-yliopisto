<div>To find the shortest distance between all pair of vertices the best solution is to use Floyd's algorithm.</div>
<br>
<div>Create a function <strong>floyd(graph: Graph)</strong> in Python. The function takes a Graph object as an input value and returns a \(V \times V\) matrix
    (\(V\) sized list of \(V\) sized lists) containing distances between all vertex pairs (\(v_i,v_j\)). The function must work for both directed and undirected graphs.</div>

    <h4><strong>Assignment 10.2: Kruskal's Algorithm</strong> (4 points)</h4>
</div>
<div>Last week we constructed a graph with the shortest paths starting from a given vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm. Although the shortest -path graph might also be a minimal cost spanning tree (MCST), this is not guaranteed. Therefore, it is better to use an algorithm designed to produce MCST. Here we implement Kruskal's algorithm.</div>
<br>
<div>Create a function <strong>kruskal(graph: Graph)</strong> in Python. The function takes a Graph object as an input value and
    returns a new Graph object that has only the edges that constructs the minimum spanning tree computed by Kruskal's algorithm. The created graph is undirected and
    you can assume that the original graph is undirected too.</div>
<br>
<div>For example the on the left we have the original undirected graph and on the right we have a graph that the function produces.</div>
