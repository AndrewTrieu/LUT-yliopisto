In networking, a socket is an endpoint for communication between two
devices. To open a socket, we would use the socket() system call in
our network application. This system call takes a number of
parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol
to be used for the socket. Once the socket has been created, we can
use the bind() system call to associate the socket with a specific
network address, and then use the listen() system call to listen for
incoming connections on the socket.</p>
<p lang="en-in" align="justify" xml:lang="en-in">
In addition to the socket(), bind(), and listen() system calls
mentioned earlier, there is also the accept() system call. This
system call is used to accept incoming connections on a socket. When
a client connects to the socket, the accept() call will return a new
socket descriptor that is connected to the client. This new socket
can be used to communicate with the client, while the original socket
continues to listen for new connections.</p>
<p lang="en-in" align="justify" xml:lang="en-in">
To close a socket, we would use the close() system call. This will
release the resources associated with the socket and close the
connection. We can also use the shutdown() system call to close the
connection in a more graceful manner, allowing any pending data to be
sent and acknowledged before the connection is closed.</p>

An input and output stream is a way to read and write data to a
socket in a network application. To create an input and output
stream, we would first need to open a socket using the socket()
system call, as described earlier. Once the socket is open, we can
use the getInputStream() and getOutputStream() methods on the socket
object to create the input and output streams.</p>

The accept() system call is used by a server to accept incoming
connections from clients. When a client connects to the server, the
accept() call will block until a connection is made. Once a
connection is established, accept() will return a new socket
descriptor that is connected to the client. This new socket can be
used to communicate with the client, while the original socket
continues to listen for new connections.</p><br><p></p>
