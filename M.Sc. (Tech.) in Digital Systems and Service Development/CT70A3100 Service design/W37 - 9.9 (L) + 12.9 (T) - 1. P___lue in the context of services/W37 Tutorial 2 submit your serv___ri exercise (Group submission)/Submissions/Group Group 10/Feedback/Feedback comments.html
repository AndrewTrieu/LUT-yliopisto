<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Adding some text or indication of the chronology of events to the collage slide (#2) would make it more understandable. The pictures of use in context at the right side of the slides are good.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The main problem is that you didn't document going to Sibelius Hall... this was the scenario to follow, but you don't have photos nor screenshots of that. You seem to be missing documentation for returning the bike, and/or stopping for a while at Sibelius Hall and then possibly return to campus. With a service scenario, you need to go all the way!</p>
