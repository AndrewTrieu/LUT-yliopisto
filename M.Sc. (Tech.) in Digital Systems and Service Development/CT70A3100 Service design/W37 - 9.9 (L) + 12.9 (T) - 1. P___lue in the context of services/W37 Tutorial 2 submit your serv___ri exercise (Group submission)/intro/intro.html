<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Upload the service safari exercise here!<br></p><p></p><p>The PDF should
contain 3 slides.</p>

<p>Slide 1: Name of the service, your
group number, and your names</p>

<p>Slide 2: Choose your key
documentation (the photos, screenshots, notes,
and sketches) that make most sense to explain how you used the service and
make a collage of them on Slide 2. You can add some text
if you want to clarify things. Keep it simple for now. You will use more of the
documentation for GR1, so save it!</p>

<p>Slide 3: Fill in the following</p>

<div>1. What is the value proposition
presented by the provider (or what do you think it is in case it is not explicitly stated by the provider)? Did the value proposition match your needs in the service safari scenario?</div>

<div>2. What worked well and what didnâ€™t
work well?</div>

<div>3. What products and services (including other than the chosen one) did you have to use? Was the switch from one service to another easy or cumbersome?</div>

<div>4. What actors could you identify as contributing to value co-creation?
What was their contribution?</div><br><p></p>
