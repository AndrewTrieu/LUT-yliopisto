<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Upload the group report here. Please remember to include the AI statement. If you have used AI, please include all the prompts that you have used. The AI statement does not count in counting the page numbers for GR2 nor IR2, so it comes as an extra to the limit indicated in the instructions.</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Also, if you have Appendices, they don't count in the maximum page number allowed, so Appendices can come after the maximum 7 pages allowed. Remember that you can use the Appendices to put big images, or any information that the reader does not have to have in the main report, but that are good to show that you have done a good job.&nbsp;Do notify the reader in you main text to go check them in the correct Appendix!</p>
