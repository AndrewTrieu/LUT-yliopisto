<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">3.5 You missed writing a title and especially the required second part of the title (see instruction slides). You also missed correctly referring to literature and the videos (see LUT library instructions for that). I appreciate your reflection on the course not meeting your expectations but please write this in the course evaluation. You are finally missing a conclusion for your report.&nbsp;<br></p>
