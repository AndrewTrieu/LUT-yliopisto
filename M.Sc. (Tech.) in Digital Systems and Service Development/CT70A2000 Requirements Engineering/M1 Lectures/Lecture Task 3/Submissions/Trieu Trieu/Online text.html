One key weakness is the ambiguity of "regular intervals" â€” it does not specify the precise interval, leaving it open to interpretation. Additionally, the phrase "not less than every 60 seconds" suggests that updates could occur after more than 60 seconds, potentially causing inconsistent or infrequent updates. The requirement also fails to account for varying system loads, network conditions, or the importance of the task status. To improve it, the requirement could be revised for precision and flexibility; for example, specifying the interval to be exactly 30 seconds.<br></p>
