Terms like "transcribe" are ambiguous, leading to potential misunderstandings about whether the notes should be a full transcript or a summarized version. Additionally, non-functional requirements, like accuracy, compatibility, and performance, are missing. This lack of detail makes it difficult to validate whether the final software will meet the user’s expectations or if it is even technically feasible.</p></div><div><div data-callout-metadata="" data-callout-fold="" data-callout="question"><div dir="auto"><div><strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle><path d="M9.09 9a3 3 0 0 1 5.83 1c0 2-3 3-3 3"></path><path d="M12 17h.01"></path></svg> What are the steps to decompose this statement for better requirement gathering and validation?</strong></div><div><br></div></div></div></div><div><p dir="auto">To properly gather and validate requirements, the statement needs to be broken down further. Engineers should ask clarifying questions to define specific functional needs, such as how recordings are triggered and the level of transcription detail. They should also explore non-functional requirements, like accuracy, compatibility, and performance, to ensure the software will perform adequately. Creating use cases and scenarios can help model different user interactions, while stakeholder input will be crucial to prioritizing key features and avoiding scope creep.</p></div><br><p></p>
