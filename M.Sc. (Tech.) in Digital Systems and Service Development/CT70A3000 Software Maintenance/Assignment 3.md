| Techniques                  | Key factors                                             | Advantages                                           | Limitations                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dataflow analysis-based     | Based on dataflow and structural coverage criteria      | Precise identification of affected def-use pairs     | Low on safety, imprecise                                                             |
| Slicing-based               | Based on slicing of programs or dependence graph models | Can handle inter-procedural dependencies             | Low on safety, imprecise, computationally inefficient compared to Dataflow-based     |
| Module level firewall-based | Based on analyzing dependencies among modules           | More efficient as only modified modules are analysed | Low on safety, highly imprecise                                                      |
| Modified code entity-based  | Level of granularity can be adapted                     | Safe, and the most efficient technique               | Highly imprecise                                                                     |
| Textual differencing-based  | Based on textual differencing of C programs             | Safe, and easy to implement a prototype              | Imprecise, and difficult to adapt to other languages, inefficient for large programs |
| Graph walk-based            | Based on analysis of control flow models                | Safe, and the most precise technique                 | Less efficient than Module level firewall-based and Modified code entity-based       |

| Firewall-based      | Based on  dependencies among modules                                                                    | Computationally efficient                                                                                                       | Unsafe and imprecise, need to be extended to handle certain object-oriented features                                                                              |
| Program model-based | Based on dependencies among class elements or control flow models                                       | Safe, and more precise than Firewall-based, suitable for multiple classes and programs                                          | Computationally inefficient compared to Firewall-based, does not consider some common object-oriented constructs, expensive for large programs with small changes |
| Design model-based  | Based on different UML design models, assuming traceability between models, source code, and test cases | More efficient than Program model-based, suitable large programs,  high level of abstraction, independent of the implementation | Not safe, less precise than Program model-based                                                                                                                   |
| Specification-based | Based on requirement models, assuming traceability from the specifications to test cases                | More efficient than Program model-based, suitable for systems with large test suites, platform-independent                      | Not safe, less precise than Program model-based                                                                                                                   |
