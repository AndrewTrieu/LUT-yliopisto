>**Explain why a software system that is used in a real-world environment must change orÂ become progressively less useful.**

Software systems need to adapt and evolve to stay useful over time. This is primarily because user needs and requirements are constantly changing. As businesses expand and markets shift, new features and capabilities become necessary to keep the software effective and relevant. Without updates, the software risks becoming outdated and less satisfying for users.

Technological advancements also drive the need for software changes. New hardware, operating systems, and programming techniques emerge regularly, which can render older software incompatible or less efficient. Updating software helps it take advantage of these advancements and maintain optimal performance.

Security is another critical factor. New threats and vulnerabilities are continuously discovered, making outdated software more susceptible to attacks. Regular updates and patches are essential to protect against these risks and ensure data security and system integrity.

Regulatory and compliance requirements also change over time, necessitating software modifications to meet current laws and standards. Additionally, competition in the market pushes businesses to continually improve their software. Competitors may offer more advanced or user-friendly solutions, prompting the need for enhancements to retain and attract customers.

>**What are the principal factors that affect the costs of system reengineering?**

Several key factors influence the costs associated with system reengineering. One important factor is the quality of the existing software. Systems with well-documented code, a modular design, and minimal technical debt are generally less expensive to reengineer compared to those with poor documentation, a monolithic structure, and extensive technical debt. High-quality software allows for easier analysis, modification, and testing, thereby reducing reengineering costs.

The availability of advanced tools for reengineering is another significant factor. Tools for code analysis, refactoring, and automated testing can significantly reduce the effort and time required for reengineering. These tools facilitate more efficient processes and can handle complex tasks that would be labor-intensive if done manually.

Data conversion needs also impact reengineering costs. When a system requires large volumes of data to be converted to new formats or integrated with new systems, the reengineering process becomes more complex and expensive. This requires careful planning, validation, and migration strategies to ensure data integrity and consistency.

The expertise of the staff involved in reengineering is crucial as well. Skilled professionals with experience in the specific technologies and methodologies used in the reengineering process can execute tasks more efficiently and effectively. A lack of such expertise can lead to longer project durations, higher labor costs, and increased risk of errors.
