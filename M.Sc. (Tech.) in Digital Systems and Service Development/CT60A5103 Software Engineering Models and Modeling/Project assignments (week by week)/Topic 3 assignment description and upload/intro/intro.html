<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><p><strong><u></u></strong></p><p><strong><u>About this task</u></strong></p><p>You can find this week's assignment description in here. On this, you work on together as a group and return as a PDF for grading&nbsp;using the associated Moodle assignment link.</p><p></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mandatory Assignment (topic 3, submit via Moodle as PDF)</strong><br></p><p><u>General requirements</u></p><p>Max 2 pages (+1 cover page). Please concentrate on the diagram and then explaining the rationale behind its design.</p><p>Submit this assignment via Moodle as PDF (see the exercises and assignment page for the return link).</p><p><br></p><p><u>Assignment description</u></p><p>This week's assignment involves examining a competiting app from the surface and considering how its actions could be modeled.<br></p><p>Find either an environmental measurement program (such as Shelly, RuuviTag or decibel measurement) or a media streaming program (such as Spotify or iTunes), depending on the project assignment you have chosen. Install and examine the app. If you don't have a suitable mobile device with apps, ask if one person in your group has one.</p><p>Answer the following questions:</p><p></p><ol><li>What views and view-related data objects could exist in the app?</li><li>What data does the app use or transfer when you use it?</li></ol><p></p><p>Then, select one basic use case scenario from the app you have selected (similar to complexity in making a purchase, liking a social media post, sharing a photo on Instagram/Mastodon/Bluesky, or sending an email). Draw a simple communication diagram (<a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-communication-diagram/">example</a>) of the different views involved, and the data and information the app uses to switch between the views.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>Deliverables</u></p><p>There are two main deliverables in this assignment. The UML communication diagram and an explanation of its design rationale.</p><p>When explaining the diagram, answer minimally all of the questions asked in the assignment description.</p><p></p><p>Include the Declaration of AI Use at the end of the assignment. The declaration is required for grading the work whether you used AI tools or not.</p><br><p></p><strong><u>FAQ</u><br></strong>Q: What is a view?<br>A: In the terminology we use in the course, it is a single screenful of content. Think of one mobile phone app screen or for example a single web page. We will discuss these more in next week's MVC (BCE) lectures.<br><br>Q: What is a view-related data object?<br>A: If we think this from an object-oriented programming or database programming perspective, it is an object that enables the view to be rendered. For one view, you are likely to need several objects. In social media, you would have "User," "Post," "Feed (collection)" and so on.<br><br><p><strong><u>Declaration of AI Use</u></strong></p>
<p>In a separate chapter at the end of the document, list the following.</p>
<p>1) Name all AI systems that were used in the development of the contents of this document, and for each</p>
<p>2) How and where they were used (illustrations, proofreading, getting ideas for text, to generate diagrams etc.) or</p>
<p>3) Clearly state that no AI assistance or tools were used in this assignment.</p>
<p>This Declaration is mandatory part of the submission and leaving it out means that the work is incomplete and should not be graded. Declaring that no AI was used in the development of the document, but getting high number in TurnItIn AI check is also a valid grounds for failing the work just by itself.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p>
