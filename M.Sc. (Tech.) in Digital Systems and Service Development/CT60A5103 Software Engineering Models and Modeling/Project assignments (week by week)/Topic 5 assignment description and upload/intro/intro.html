On this, you work on together as a group and return as a PDF for grading using the associated Moodle assignment link.</span></p><p></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Mandatory Assignment (topic 5, submit via Moodle as PDF)</strong><br></p><p><u>General requirements</u></p><p>Max 2-3 pages (+1 cover page). Please concentrate on the diagrams and then explaining the rationale behind their design.</p><p>Submit this assignment via Moodle as PDF (see the exercises and assignment page for the return link).</p><p><br></p><p><u>Assignment description</u></p><p>This week's assignment involves taking previous week's case description and the BCE models you created.</p><p><strong>Step 0.</strong>&nbsp;Have a look at the previous week's case description (topic 4) and the BCE model you created at the end of the assignment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 1.&nbsp;</strong>Start by reviewing tutorials below.</p><p>First, review the tutorial on converting robustness (or BCE) diagrams to collaborations diagrams from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml-collaboration-diagram/">https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml-collaboration-diagram/</a></p><p>Then, review the tutorial on building a sequence diagram from robustness diagram (or BCE models) from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/robustness-analysis-tutorial/">https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/robustness-analysis-tutorial/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Convert BCE model from topic 4 assignment to two different UML diagrams</p><p>First model: Convert the BCE model (or robustness diagram) to a collaboration diagram.</p><p>Second model: Select one use case scenario, explain it briefly, and draw a sequence diagram based on it.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Take care to not make the sequence&nbsp;diagram too complex. If it looks like that the sequence diagram would have more than eight rows, it is alright to stop at the eight row.</p><p><u><br></u></p><p><u>Case description</u></p><p>Please refer to previous week's case and the analysis. This week is a sequel to the initial work you did in topic 4.</p><p><u><br></u></p><p><u>Deliverables</u></p><p></p><span lang="EN-US">Following the instructions above, 1) provide a collaboration diagram and 2) a sequence diagram. Describe the design rationale and what happens in each diagram in your own words. Use complete sentences, add captions to your figures, and pay attention to flow and readability of your report.<br><br>Return this work as a single PDF file into Moodle.<br><br><p>Include the Declaration of AI Use at the end of the assignment. The declaration is required for grading the work whether you used AI tools or not.</p><p><br></p></span><span lang="EN-US"></span><p><strong><u>Declaration of AI Use</u></strong></p>
<p>In a separate chapter at the end of the document, list the following.</p>
<p>1) Name all AI systems that were used in the development of the contents of this document, and for each</p>
<p>2) How and where they were used (illustrations, proofreading, getting ideas for text, to generate diagrams etc.) or</p>
<p>3) Clearly state that no AI assistance or tools were used in this assignment.</p>
<p>This Declaration is mandatory part of the submission and leaving it out means that the work is incomplete and should not be graded. Declaring that no AI was used in the development of the document, but getting high number in TurnItIn AI check is also a valid grounds for failing the work just by itself.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p>
