<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><u>About this task</u></b></p><p>This page contains both activity instructions and return link, but you will need to refer back to the main project case: AudioNow or Envirosense. On this, you work on together on a small portion of the entire course project and return as a PDF for grading&nbsp;using the associated Moodle assignment link. You will have the chance to revise and then submit the entire course project as a single cohesive report at the end of the course.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Mandatory Assignment (topic 2, submit via Moodle as PDF)</b><br></p><p><u>General requirements</u></p><p>Max 2 pages (+1 cover page). Please concentrate on designing a good process model, explaining it, and detailing the deliverables listed below at a general level. When designing, think about why the case company (see full project assignment) needs it and its relationship to the project.</p><p>Submit this assignment via Moodle as PDF (see the exercises and assignment page for the return link)</p><p>If accepted, you may revise and include this deliverable as part of the final version of the course project report.</p><p><u><br></u></p><p><u>Assignment introduction and motivation</u></p><p>Some companies have technical or artistic talent, but they are unfamiliar with how to organize for software engineering and how to set up their software engineering process. In this case, imagine yourself as consultants who help the company described below to set up and customize a software engineering process for their use.</p><p>In the case described below, you are consultants hired by the case company to help design a process that meets design requirements.</p><p><u><br></u></p><p><u>Case description</u></p><p></p><p><span lang="EN-US">In this case, you and your team are a new software consultancy and has just received their first project assignment, or the course project case. During the bidding process, your client requests the following information and schedules.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">A proof-of-concept demo and full design documentation before the approval of further development work. Design can be modified during the development based on the feedback.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">A test plan for quality assurance including testing with the real target audience users</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">Monthly reviews on progress, including review data from user testing</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">Proof that the work is actually supervised, and that there is management of daily tasks</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">The project has to be completed in 12 months, of which 1 month has to be reserved for quality assurance and acceptance testing only.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">Client pays for reasonable amount of working hours only and is not willing to pay salary for more than 10 people.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">You can hire a maximum of 7 people, of which 3 are mainly developers and 3 mainly artists. The seventh person is mostly occupied by the sales and management tasks, but in reality currently everyone does a bit of everything. Your consultancy already has access to the necessary tools and object libraries and other assets to technically construct the product.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><u><br></u></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><u>Case assignment</u></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">This is where your team is brought in. You task is to create a process model, deadlines, document specifications and internal schedule for the software consultancy to use and apply on their project. Define how the development work should be done, what metrics should be collected, what things should be tested (and how they should be tested), and what things has to be documented. Draw a process model diagram, define internal deadlines for each phase, and define the necessary documents on the “table of content”-level. Also explain why you chose those particular ways to do the work.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><br></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US"><u>Deliverables</u></span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Write a short document that describes a software engineering process model that your team has planned. Minimally, include following in the process document.</span></p><p></p><ul><li><span lang="EN-US">The software engineering process model and the rationale for selecting it (see course literature)</span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">What steps are in the process model, what deadlines are in the process (internal schedule), and what things are documented each step.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">Briefly describe each document or artefact that is outputted (e.g. design or QA document). Do not describe actual content, but describe the rough structure and its purpose.</span></li><li><span lang="EN-US">Testing and metrics - where do they occur and how they are reported by a) developers to consultancy and b) consultancy to client?</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span lang="EN-US">For other components to include in the assignment, read the case assignment and case description carefully. The client company requires several documents and artefacts from your consultancy.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US">Return the group work via course Moodle page with the document as one pdf file, including the PDF file. If you are experiencing problems, please contact the course lecturer.<br></span></p><br><u>Q&amp;A</u><br>In this part, we have collected some questions previously asked by students.<br><br>Q: I am unsure how to get started.<br>A: Review Sommerville on software process models and how Sommerville's coursebook and slides have pictured software process models. The first part of topic 2 lectures (Sommerville on fundamental software engineering activities) is also a good part to start watching.<br><br>Q: What is a software process model diagram?<br>A: In this assignment, you do not have to use any specific modeling language. Have a look at the visual examples and then create your own.<br><br>Q: Do I need to design the software product itself or for example draw prototype visuals?<br>A: No. Just describe what is the purpose of the prototype and what content a prototype should have.<br><br><br><p><strong><u>Declaration of AI Use</u></strong></p><p>In a separate chapter at the end of the document, list the following.</p><p>1) Name all AI systems that were used in the development of the contents of this document, and for each</p><p>2) How and where they were used (illustrations, proofreading, getting ideas for text, to generate diagrams etc.) or</p><p>3) Clearly state that no AI assistance or tools were used in this assignment.</p><p>This Declaration is mandatory part of the submission and leaving it out means that the work is incomplete and should not be graded. Declaring that no AI was used in the development of the document, but getting high number in TurnItIn AI check is also a valid grounds for failing the work just by itself.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p></p><p></p>
