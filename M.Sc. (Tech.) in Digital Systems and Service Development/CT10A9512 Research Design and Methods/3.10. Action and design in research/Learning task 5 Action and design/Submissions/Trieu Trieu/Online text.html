Based on this definition, in software engineering, a weak mode of research could be a survey on developers' preferences for programming languages, while a strong mode of research could be investigating the impact of different programming paradigms on software maintainability.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Newell.

In contrast, design research focuses on creating and testing artifacts, such as products or systems, to solve specific problems or improve user experiences, with an emphasis on learning through the design process and refining solutions over time.</p></div></span><span><div><p dir="auto"><em>ChatGPT was used to rewrite this answer to make it better.</em></p></div></span><strong><br></strong><p></p>
