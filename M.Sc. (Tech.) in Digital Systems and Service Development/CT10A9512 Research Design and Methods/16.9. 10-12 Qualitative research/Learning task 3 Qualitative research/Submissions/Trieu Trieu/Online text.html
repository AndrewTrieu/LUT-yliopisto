classification? Is it positivist, interpretive or critical approach? 
Why?</strong><span><br>I would classify grounded theory in Orlikowski &amp; Baroudi's classification as interpretivist because it focuses on understanding the meaning of human actions and the social context in which they take place. Interpretivist research aims to understand the subjective experiences and meanings from the actions and surroundings that an individual perceives.<br>Similarly in grounded theory, researchers examine data to understand the relations and interactions within the social world. This method stands in contrast to positivism, which is simply measuring and observing from an external perspective. This approach allows researchers to generate theories that are grounded in people's experiences and perceptions.<br><br><em>No AI tools were used in this answer.</em></span><em><strong><br><br></strong></em></li><li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Give an example of how ethnography could be used in software engineering research.<br></strong><span><div><p dir="auto">Ethnography means the process of recording and describing a culture of a specific people and their traits, patterns, and principles of coherent integration. In software engineering, ethnography could be used to explore the effects of remote work on communication and collaboration in software development teams, for example. The research could identify any communication gaps and discover the best practices for team collaboration.</p></div><div><p dir="auto"><em>No AI tools were used in this answer.</em></p></div></span><strong><br></strong></li></ol>
