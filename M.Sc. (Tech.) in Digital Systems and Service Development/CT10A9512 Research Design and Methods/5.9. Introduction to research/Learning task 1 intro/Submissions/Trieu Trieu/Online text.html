It also encompasses about design, abstraction, and problem-solving in a constantly changing environment. Classifying software engineering within the narrow definition of science misses out on the creative processes that are essential to development, as well as the complexities that come with user interactions and shifting requirements. This approach risks ignoring the many important methodologies that define the field.</p></li><li data-line="3" dir="auto"><p><strong>Why is it difficult to be value free in research, especially when studying humans?</strong><br>It is difficult to be value free in research because as humans, we carry biases in to study. Human behavior is very complex, influenced by social, cultural, and psychological factors. These values and assumptions affect the choice of methodology and the interpretation of results, which make complete objectivity near impossible.</p></li><li data-line="6" dir="auto"><p><strong>What do you expect of this course?</strong><br>I expect to learn a bit more about different research methodologies commonly used for software engineer as I expect to work on my thesis very soon.</p></li></ol></div>
