1. **What is the difference between a view and a viewpoint? Why are both needed?**  
	
	In architectural representation, a "view" refers to the graphical depiction of specific architectural structures or elements. Views offer concrete visualisations of design concepts, allowing architects and stakeholders to visualise the proposed structures. On the other hand, a "viewpoint" encompasses the conventions and templates used to construct and interpret these views effectively. Viewpoints ensure consistency and clarity across these representations by establishing standardised methods and conventions.
	
	While a view is the end result, a viewpoint serves as the guiding principle or methodology behind its creation. Both are essential in architectural communication.  
	
2. **Why is the context view important?**  
    
    It is important to recognise the significance of the context view when working with systems analysis and design. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is not always understood by all stakeholders, which might end up in miscommunications. This can also lead to incorrect assumptions about the constraints, external entities, and system scope. Furthermore, the context view reveals integration, which is essential to modern systems. Each portion of a system is interconnected with all the other components of it, with business partner systems, with other systems, and with local and global platforms. Understanding the interdependence through the context view enables a thorough comprehension of the operation of the system and its wider consequences within its ecosystem.
	
3. **What is a container and what purpose does it serve?**
	  
	A container refers to a self-contained functional entity that can be deployed independently. It is a package bundling all the necessary components and dependencies within its own execution environment. Unlike a monolithic architecture where components are tightly integrated, a container allows for more flexibility by carrying individual components inside them. Components are functional elements operate within the same process and environment, ensuring efficient resource utilisation and streamlined deployment.
