[[Software and system architectures]]

1. **Why do you think architecture is important? Why do people make architecture descriptions?**
	
	In software engineering, architecture is essential because it allows stakeholders to communicate effectively by providing a common abstraction of the system, it makes early design decisions easier by allowing the structure of the system to be analysed. It also offers a transferable abstractionâ€”a compact, easily comprehensible model that shows how components interact and can be reused for multiple projects. This maintains consistency in design quality, permits early detection of any problems, and guarantees that all stakeholders have a common understanding on the project.
	
	To properly explain and record a software system's architecture choices and organisational structure, we need architecture descriptions. These explanations make sure that all stakeholders in the project have a common understanding of the system. They support the identification of risks, the assessment of feasibility, and the fulfilment of functional and non-functional needs. Architecture descriptions also bring regulatory compliance and standards into the organisation, which act as a blueprint for
	development, and make maintenance and future improvements easier. 
	
2. **Why is architecture an organisational concept?**
	
	Architecture serves as an organisational concept by providing a structured framework that guides the planning, decision-making, and communication processes within a project or organisation. With architecture, stakeholders can better communicate the project's objectives and make critical decisions. The blueprint and architectural documents act as references, translating complex ideas into comprehensible plans and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. This systematic approach helps align different teams and activities towards a common goal, facilitating efficient cross-team collaboration and coherent software development.
    
3. **What are your expectations of this course?**
	
	In this course, I want to learn how to create good software architectures that provides a comprehensive understanding on the system. In addition, I would like to be able to assess the quality of current designs and determine whether modifications are necessary.
