software engineering</span></b></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Your task is to write down the pros of cons of using
smart systems and AI-based systems in software engineering, like programming
assistants for code completion and code writing, and AI in testing and
debugging (as presented in the lecture).</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Also incorporate concepts like automation and
augmentation and elaborate how smart systems and AI can take on certain roles
in software engineering.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">Hand in a PDF document that includes a short
description of how smart systems/AI can be beneficial in at least 3 (three)
software engineering processes as mentioned above and present pros (benefits)
and cons (negative consequences and risks) of these practices. Then further
elaborate on these 3 (three) processes in regard to whether they fully automate
tasks or whether they augment humans (software engineers) in their daily work</span><span style="font-family: Montserrat, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
